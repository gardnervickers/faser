/// what operations are permitted on the open file. The [`File::open`] and
/// [`File::create`] methods are aliases for commonly used options using this
/// builder.
///
/// Generally speaking, when using `OpenOptions`, you'll first call
/// [`OpenOptions::new`], then chain calls to methods to set each option, then
/// call [`OpenOptions::open`], passing the path of the file you're trying to
/// open. This will give you a [`io::Result`] with a [`File`] inside that you
/// can further operate on.
